# Pocket Apps

A set of small, mobile-friendly everyday apps: money, travel, tools and a few for fun. They need no installation or build step and run in any browser.
Live at https://mangoomeh.github.io/pocket-apps/

- **Works offline:** after the first visit, every app opens without a connection (handy abroad or in a basement
  restaurant). A service worker (`sw.js`) keeps a copy of every page and file; online, pages still come fresh from the
  network.
- **Add to Home Screen:** each app has its own icon and opens straight into that app, full screen.
- **Your data stays on your phone,** and the browser is asked to keep it. **Backup** on the home screen saves
  everything (including receipt photos, chats and the floor plan) to one file you can keep in Files, iCloud Drive or
  Google Drive, and restores it on a new phone.

## Apps

### 💵 Petty Cash (`petty-cash/`)

A cash denomination counter with a transaction checker.

- **Opening balance setup:** enter how many of each note and coin you have (SGD, $100 down to 5¢).
- **Transaction checker:** enter the purchase amount, tap + for each note or coin you take out, and add any change you
  received. *Confirm* only deducts from your cash on hand when the cash you selected equals the purchase amount.
- **History with undo, and low cash warnings.** "Export to spreadsheet" saves the history as a CSV file, e.g. for a
  reimbursement claim.
- **Two themes:** modern, or retro Windows 95 (title bar, bevelled buttons, LCD balance, taskbar). The 🖥️ button in
  the header switches between them, and the choice is remembered on that device.

### 🍣 Sushiro Tracker (`sushiro/`)

Counts plates during a meal and works out the bill.

- **Plate counter:** one + and − per plate colour. The defaults are Red $2.30, Silver $2.90, Gold $3.90 and Black $4.90,
  and you can edit them under Settings to match your outlet.
- **Specials:** add any dish at a custom price (ramen, drinks, desserts).
- **Live bill:** the subtotal plus 10% service charge, then 9% GST on the subtotal and service charge, as Singapore
  requires. You can change either rate or set it to 0.
- **Saved visits:** save each meal with the outlet, the items and the bill, and see this month's visits, plates and spending.
  A saved visit keeps the prices it was charged at.
- **Receipt check:** snap the receipt, or paste its text from iPhone Live Text or Google Lens. The app reads the total
  and compares it with what you tracked, for example "The receipt is $2.76 more. Maybe 1 Red plate wasn't counted?".
  Text recognition runs on the phone with [Tesseract.js](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/), which downloads
  about 10 MB on first use. Nothing is uploaded. If the total is misread you can correct it by hand.
- **Plate counts from the receipt:** Sushiro receipts list items by price (`$2.3 Sushi 20 $46.00`), so the scan also
  reads each item. Sushi lines are matched to plate colours and shown next to your counts ("Red: receipt 20 · you
  19"), and other items (chawanmushi, soup, dishes) are listed. One button fills the meal in from the receipt. The
  reader is built to cope with common misreads on thermal paper, and it says when some lines couldn't be read,
  because the items then don't add up to the subtotal. Pasting text from Live Text or Google Lens gives the best
  results.
- **Receipt photos:** a compressed copy of each photo is kept with its saved visit in the browser's IndexedDB on that
  device.
- **Read with my AI (optional):** under Settings, point the app at Ollama on your PC (the same address as Local
  Chat) and pick a vision model such as `qwen3-vl:8b`. "🤖 Read with my AI" sends the receipt photo to your own PC,
  asks the model only to transcribe the text, and runs that text through the same parser and checks as the
  built-in reader (`cleanTranscript` in `src/receipt.js` flattens any Markdown first).

### 💸 Split (`split/`)

Shares costs in a group of friends (a trip, a flat, a dinner) and works out who pays whom.

- **Groups:** name a group and list the people. You can have several groups.
- **Expenses:** what it was for, the amount, who paid, and how to split it: **equally** among the people you tick,
  by **exact amounts**, or by **shares** (e.g. 2 shares for someone who had two nights). Each person's part is shown as
  you type. "Add 10% service charge + 9% GST" works out the nett total from the menu prices. Tap an expense to edit or
  delete it.
- **Balances and settle up:** who is owed and who owes, and the fewest payments that square everyone up (at most one
  fewer than the number of people). "Mark as paid" records a payment; payments can also be added by hand.
- **PayNow QR:** add a PayNow mobile number or UEN to a person, and each payment to them gets a PayNow QR for the exact
  amount that any Singapore banking app can scan. The SGQR text and its checksum are built in `src/split.js`; the QR
  image is drawn by [qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator), loaded from the CDN when
  first needed.
- **Sharing without accounts:** "Share link" puts the whole group, compressed, in the link's `#` part, so it never
  reaches a server. Each phone keeps its own copy; opening a link adds the group or merges it into the copy already
  there. Every expense and person has an id and an edit time, so additions, edits and deletions from different phones
  all survive, and merging in any order gives the same result. "Copy summary" makes a who-pays-whom message with the
  link for the group chat.
- **Who are you?** is kept only on your phone and is used for "You owe $12.40" and "you lent" notes.
- **Other currencies:** pick the currency next to the amount (THB, JPY, MYR…). Today's rate is filled in from
  [open.er-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com) (free, no key) and can be changed to match your card or money
  changer. The rate is saved with the expense, so balances don't move later. Balances, settling up and PayNow are in
  the group's home currency (SGD unless you pick another before adding expenses).
- **From other apps:** Sushiro's "Split this bill" and Trip Planner's "Expenses in Split" open Split with the bill
  or the trip's group ready (`#add=` and `#trip=` links).

### 🧳 Trip Planner (`trip/`)

A day-by-day itinerary and a packing list for each trip.

- **Plan:** one card per day of the trip. Add activities, food, transport and stays with an optional time, a place
  (which links to Google Maps, with the destination added) and notes such as booking references. Timed items are
  listed in time order. Today is highlighted during the trip, and the header counts down ("12 days to go") and then
  counts days ("Day 3 of 7"). If the dates change, items left outside them are kept under "Not on a day".
- **Packing:** a list worked out from the trip. Clothes scale with the number of nights (capped at 4 days' worth if
  you can do laundry); going overseas adds passport, adaptor and eSIM; carry-on only marks liquids "under 100 ml"; and
  activities (beach, hiking, work, snow, nice dinners) add their own items. Tick things off, hide what's packed,
  remove suggestions you don't need, add your own, and "Untick all" to pack for the trip home.
- **Weather:** "Check the weather" looks up the destination on [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) (free, no key)
  and uses the forecast when the trip is within about two weeks, otherwise the same dates last year. Cold, rain or
  heat add a coat, an umbrella or sunscreen to the list. You can also set the weather yourself.
- **Sharing:** the same no-server links as Split (`src/sync.js`). The link carries the plan and trip details and
  merges into a friend's copy; packing ticks stay on each phone, since everyone packs their own bag. "Copy itinerary"
  gives a text version for the group chat.
- **Add to calendar:** saves the plan as an `.ics` file that Google or Apple Calendar can import: the trip as an
  all-day event, timed items as one-hour events and untimed ones as all-day events.
- **Expenses in Split:** opens this trip's group in Split, or starts one named after the trip.

### 🛡️ Security Watch (`security/`)

The latest security vulnerabilities and news in one place, with a watch list for the things you use.

- **Exploited:** vulnerabilities [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) has confirmed
  attackers are using, added in the last 7, 30 or 90 days. Each shows the vendor and product, whether it's used in
  ransomware, its [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/) score (the chance it's exploited in the next 30 days), what to do,
  and links to the NVD and CVE.org.
- **New CVEs:** critical or high vulnerabilities published in the last 24 hours or 7 days, from the
  [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov), highest score first (CVSS 4.0, then 3.1, 3.0, 2.0), with EPSS scores.
- **News:** BleepingComputer, The Hacker News, SecurityWeek, Krebs on Security, Schneier on Security, the UK NCSC and
  CISA advisories, plus security stories from Hacker News, newest first with duplicates removed. CVE numbers in a story
  link to the NVD.
- **Watch list:** vendors and products you use (e.g. "Fortinet, Chrome, iOS"). Matches are marked on every tab, can
  be filtered to, and are counted in the header.
- **Package check:** paste `lodash@4.17.15`, `requests==2.19.0` or `go github.com/x/y 1.2.3` lines and see known
  vulnerabilities from [OSV](https://osv.dev), with the versions that fix them.
- **Where the data comes from:** news sites don't let web pages read their feeds, and CISA's full list is 1.8 MB, so
  the Pages workflow runs `tools/build-feeds.js` on every deploy and every 3 hours, and publishes the news and the last
  90 days of CISA's list as `security/data.json` (about 140 KB). The NVD, EPSS, OSV and Hacker News are asked directly
  by the page. Nothing needs a key. If `data.json` is missing, the page reads CISA's list itself.

### 🧮 GX-84 Calculator (`calc84/`)

A handheld graphing calculator modelled on the TI-84 Plus CE. It's a recreation, not an emulator: no Texas
Instruments software is used.

- **Keypad:** the full 84-style keypad with 2nd (blue) and ALPHA (green) functions, A-LOCK, an arrow pad that
  repeats while held, and keyboard support on computers (digits, operators, Enter, Backspace, Esc, arrows).
- **Home screen:** TI order of operations (`2^3^2 = 64`, `⁻2² = ⁻4`, implicit ×), automatic closing brackets, `Ans`
  (pressing + first gives `Ans+`), STO→ to variables A–Z and θ, ENTRY recall, ENTER to repeat, and TI-style
  errors with Quit/Goto.
- **Stacked fractions:** ALPHA + X,T,θ,n inserts an n/d fraction box, as on the TI-84 Plus CE. ▼ and ▲ move
  between the numerator and denominator. A calculation typed with fractions answers as a stacked fraction, and
  ALPHA + Y= (F1) opens the FRAC menu (n/d, ▶F◀▶D, ▶Frac, ▶Dec). Fractions also work in Y=.
- **Menus:** MATH (▶Frac, ▶Dec, ³, ³√(, ˣ√, nDeriv(, fnInt(), NUM (abs, round, iPart, fPart, int, min, max, lcm,
  gcd), PRB (rand, nPr, nCr, !, randInt), and VARS → Y-VARS.
- **Graphing:** Y= with ten colour-coded functions, WINDOW, ZOOM (ZBox, Zoom In/Out, ZDecimal, ZSquare, ZStandard,
  ZTrig, ZInteger, ZoomFit), TRACE (typing a number jumps to that X), GRAPH with a free cursor, and FORMAT (grid,
  axes, coordinates).
- **CALC:** value, zero, minimum, maximum, intersect, dy/dx and ∫f(x)dx, with Left/Right Bound and Guess prompts and
  shading for integrals.
- **TABLE and TBLSET, plus MODE** (Normal/Sci, Float/Fix 0–9, Radian/Degree). Everything is saved on the device.
- **Not yet:** STAT, lists, MATRIX, programs, APPS and complex numbers. Their keys show a short "not in this version"
  note.

### 🔎 Wallet Radar (`wallets/`)

Shows who went into a token, and when, on **Robinhood Chain** and **Solana**. It needs no keys by default and only
reads public blockchain data: there's no wallet connection and nothing to sign.

- **Search by name:** type a token's name or symbol (via DexScreener's free search) and pick it from a list of
  tokens on the chosen chain, most traded first. Copycats and tokens with "big liquidity, almost no trading" (a
  sign of a fake) are flagged. You can also paste the address directly.

- **Buyers:** the wallets that bought at least X% of a token's supply between two times. Each shows the first buy
  time, number of buys, amount sold in the window, net position, current holding, and flags:
  - **bundle:** one transaction bought for several wallets;
  - **likely a trading bot:** many buys;
  - **contract:** usually a smart wallet.

  You can save the list as a group or export it to CSV.
- **Compare:** which wallets of a saved group (or pasted addresses) bought or received another token in a time window.
- **Wallet:** which wallets an address sent tokens to (or received them from), with counts and amounts. Tap any
  wallet to follow the trail. ETH transfers need a free Blockscout key.
- **Scam flags:** token names with hidden characters (fake look-alike tokens) and look-alike addresses (address
  poisoning) are flagged.
- **Robinhood Chain data:** the chain's free public RPC. `src/onchain.js` splits requests to fit the node's limits,
  backs off when rate-limited, and fills in block times the node leaves out.
- **Solana data:** PublicNode's free node (`src/solana.js`). Solana's own public node blocks web pages, so it isn't
  used.
  - A **buy** is a wallet that signed a transaction and ended up with more of the token.
  - **Same block** flags wallets that bought in the same block, typical of launch snipers.
  - SOL transfers are included in the Wallet view.
  - Token accounts and wallet-vs-program checks are worked out on the device, so the node's restricted "indexed"
    calls aren't needed.
  - An optional Helius key can be set as a backup.

### ☯️ BaZi Calculator (`bazi/`)

Works out a Four Pillars of Destiny (八字) chart from a birth date and time.

- **Four Pillars:** the year, month, day and hour stems and branches, coloured by element, with each one's ten god
  (relative to the day master), hidden stems, 纳音 and life stage, in labelled rows. Tap any label or value for a
  plain-English explanation. If the birth time is unknown, the hour pillar is
  left out.
- **Solar terms:** the year changes at 立春 and each month at its solar term. The terms are worked out from the sun's
  position (abridged VSOP87, in `src/bazi.js`), so the app needs no tables or network and agrees with published
  times to within a minute. The chart shows which term the birth month began with.
- **Lunar (农历) birthdays:** switch the date to Lunar and pick the lunar year, month (including leap months) and
  day. The conversion (`src/lunar.js`) uses new moons and solar terms in Beijing time, as the official calendar does,
  for 1901–2099. The lunar date is also shown for any Western date.
- **Birthplace and historical time zones:** pick a city and the app uses the UTC offset that applied there on the
  birth date, from the browser's time zone history. For example, Singapore and Malaysia were UTC+7:30 until 1982,
  and China used daylight saving from 1986 to 1991. "Other" lets you pick any time zone region (which also handles daylight saving) or a fixed offset, and a longitude.
- **True solar time (optional):** the day and hour pillars use local solar time (the birthplace's longitude plus the
  equation of time). You can also choose whether 23:00 starts the next day.
- **Five elements, day master, and interactions:** element counts (with and without hidden stems), stem
  combinations and clashes, branch combinations, clashes, harms, punishments, three-harmony and directional groups,
  and the void branches.
- **Luck pillars (大运):** ten 10-year pillars, forward or backward by gender and year polarity. The start age is
  worked out from the days to the nearest solar term (3 days = 1 year). Tap a pillar to see its ten years (流年);
  the current ones are highlighted.
- **Tabs:** Chart, Summary (with the full reading below it), Luck, and More (saved charts, Match, About).
- **Summary:** one screen for people who don't want the detail: the pillars, you in a line, strengths, what to
  watch for, what helps, and whether this decade and year look favourable.
- **Reading (plain English):** what the day master says about your strengths and watch-outs, what each pillar covers
  in life, which ten-god themes are strong or missing, element balance, and what the current luck pillar and year
  bring, plus a short guide to reading a chart. The text is in `src/baziread.js` and is framed as traditional
  interpretation, not prediction.
- **Strength and favourable elements:** scores whether the day master is strong or weak (all stems and hidden
  stems, with the month counted double), shows the three classic checks (得令, 得地, 得势), and picks the useful
  element (用神) and the favourable ones. A winter or summer birth also counts Fire or Water as favourable for
  climate (调候). Luck pillars, years, months and days are marked favourable, mixed or demanding.
- **Now (Luck tab):** this year's, month's and day's pillars with their ten gods and any clashes or combinations
  with your chart, the twelve month pillars of the year (流月), and a calendar of this month's day pillars (流日).
- **Symbolic stars (神煞):** Nobleman, Academic Star, Peach Blossom, Travelling Horse, Canopy, Prosperity Star and
  Goat Blade, with where they fall.
- **No birth time:** all twelve possible hour pillars are shown; tap one to try it.
- **Share:** a link that opens the same chart (no account needed), or the chart copied as text.
- **Language:** a 中文 / EN switch in the header changes the whole app, including readings and explanations.
  English mode keeps the BaZi characters and shows the Chinese term beside its English name where it helps. The
  first visit follows the phone's language.
- **Match:** compares two charts (the current one and any saved one) on day masters, spouse star, spouse
  palaces (day branches), zodiac signs and whether each brings the other's favourable elements (`src/bazimatch.js`).
- **Saved charts** are kept on the device.

### 🧭 Feng Shui (`fengshui/`)

Flying Star (玄空飞星) and Eight Mansions (八宅) feng shui for a home and the people in it.

- **Home:** enter the main door's facing in degrees and the move-in date. The app works out the period (20-year
  元运, Period 9 is 2024–2043, from 立春), the facing and sitting mountains of the 24, and draws the flying star
  chart: base, mountain (people, health) and facing (money) stars in each of the nine palaces, coloured by whether
  they are timely in the period. Replacement stars (替卦) are used automatically when the facing is more than 4.5°
  off the centre of its mountain, and can be switched off. It names the chart type (旺山旺向, 上山下水, double
  stars at the facing or sitting), 合十, 父母三般卦, 连珠, 伏吟/反吟 and boundary (空亡) facings, and the house
  trigram. Tap a sector for its stars, combinations (e.g. 2-5, 1-4, 6-8), what it suits, this year's star and
  afflictions there, and how each household member finds it. The grid can be drawn south-up or north-up.
- **Floor plan:** add a photo, screenshot or PDF of the floor plan (e.g. an HDB plan) and drag the 3×3 grid onto
  the flat's outer walls (it starts on the walls it finds, turned to match a tilted scan; drag corners or
  edges, turn it freely, zoom in, or rotate the plan 90°). Tap the main door on the plan (or pick its side); a compass is drawn on the plan from the measured facing, to compare with the plan's north arrow, and for plans without one the app lists which way each outer wall should face so it can be checked at a window. The grid follows the walls, with the front middle
  square as the facing. Each room then shows its stars (or a person's Eight Mansions directions), squares outside
  an L-shaped flat can be marked as missing corners, and tapping a square gives its reading. The plan is kept in
  the browser's IndexedDB; PDFs are rendered with pdf.js from the CDN.
- **Family roles:** each person can be given a role (father, mother, eldest son, …). Each trigram stands for a
  family member, so sector readings, missing corners and the year's 5 Yellow and 2 Black say who they affect.
- **People:** each person's Kua number (from the 立春 year and gender) with their four good and four bad directions
  (生气, 天医, 延年, 伏位 / 祸害, 五鬼, 六煞, 绝命), East or West group, and desk and bed tips. Charts saved in the
  BaZi app can be imported, which adds the directions of their favourable elements.
- **Year:** the annual flying stars with Tai Sui, the Year Breaker, Three Killings, 5 Yellow and 2 Black, the twelve
  monthly stars with their start dates, and this month's star in each sector.
- **Compass:** uses the phone's compass (magnetic north, as a luopan does) on a 24-mountain dial; the reading can be
  sent to the Home tab. Without a sensor, set the degrees by hand.
- The calculations are in `src/fengshui.js`; schools differ, and the app says which method it uses.

### 🤖 AI for Beginners (`learnai/`)

Ten short lessons on AI in plain English, each a few cards and a three-question quiz, with progress kept on the
device.

- **Lessons:** what AI is, how it learns, how chatbots write, tokens, why AI makes things up, how to prompt,
  what it's good and bad at, staying safe (privacy, voice-clone and deepfake scams, ScamShield), pictures and
  deepfakes, and using AI every day.
- **Hands-on demos** that really work, in the browser (`src/learnai.js`): teach a scam filter (naive Bayes) and
  test it on new messages; be the chatbot with a next-word predictor and a temperature slider; split text into
  rough tokens; a prompt builder; a trust-or-check game; and a good-use-or-careful sorting game.
- **Prompts:** ready-made prompts to copy (explain a letter, cook with what's in the fridge, homework hints…).
- **Words:** a searchable glossary.

### 🦙 Local Chat (`chat/`)

A chat app for your own AI models running in [Ollama](https://ollama.com) on your PC. The page talks to Ollama
directly; chats are kept in the browser (IndexedDB) and go nowhere else.

- Streaming replies with a Stop button, regenerate, and edit-and-resend; Markdown with tables and code blocks
  (with copy buttons), rendered by a small escaping renderer in `src/chat.js`.
- Model picker from the models you've pulled, with size and family; photos for models that can see; a folded
  "reasoning" section for thinking models (Ollama's `think` option, or `<think>` tags).
- Personalities or your own system prompt, temperature and context length, chat history with search, rename,
  delete and export.
- Setup: Ollama must allow this site with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://mangoomeh.github.io`. For phones, run
  `tailscale serve --bg 11434` on the PC (and `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`) and use the Tailscale https address.
  The in-app setup guide and connection test walk through it.

The home screen also links to [Web Monopoly](https://mangoomeh.github.io/web-monopoly/),
[Morning Pick](https://mangoomeh.github.io/morning-pick/) and
[Deliberate](https://mangoomeh.github.io/deliberate/).

## Running it

```sh
npm start        # serves the apps at http://localhost:8000
npm test         # runs the unit tests (Node 18+)
npm run sw       # updates the offline file list in sw.js; run after adding or changing files
npm run feeds    # makes security/data.json (news and CISA's list) for trying Security Watch locally
npm run icons    # redraws the icons and manifests (Python 3 + Pillow + Noto Color Emoji); run after adding an app
```

The tests fail if `sw.js` is out of date, so a forgotten `npm run sw` stops the deploy rather than shipping an old
offline copy.

Every push to `main` runs the tests and publishes to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

## Layout

- `index.html`: the home screen with a tile for each app, and Backup
- `sw.js`, `shared/pwa.js`: offline use (every page loads `pwa.js`, which registers the service worker)
- `manifest.webmanifest` in each folder, and `icons/`: what a phone uses when an app is added to the home screen
- `shared/styles.css`: shared styles, including the Sushiro theme
- `shared/ui.js`: helpers every app uses (`$`, `esc`, `toast`, `switchTab`); `shared/backup.js`: the Backup card
- `petty-cash/`, `sushiro/`, `split/`, `trip/`, `security/`, `calc84/`, `wallets/`, `bazi/`, `fengshui/`, `learnai/`, `chat/`: each app's page and UI script (`sushiro/ocr.js` and `sushiro/photos.js` handle receipts)
- `src/`: the logic as pure functions (`cash.js`, `sushiro.js`, `split.js`, `trip.js`, `security.js`, `sync.js` (share links and merging), `backup.js`, `receipt.js`, `ti84.js`, `onchain.js`, `bazi.js`, `baziread.js`, `bazimatch.js`, `fengshui.js`, `plangrid.js`, `places.js`, `learnai.js`, `chat.js`, `compass.js`), with all money in integer cents
- `tests/`: unit tests for `src/`, plus checks that the offline and install files are complete
- `tools/`: `build-sw.js` (offline file list), `build-pwa.py` (icons and manifests) and `build-feeds.js` (Security Watch's data)

To add an app: create a folder with an `index.html` (copy the `<head>` of another app, which links its manifest,
icon and `pwa.js`), add a tile to the root `index.html`, add the folder to `APPS` in `tools/build-sw.js` and
`tools/build-pwa.py` and to the `cp` line in the Pages workflow, add its storage key to `STORAGE_KEYS` in
`src/backup.js`, then run `npm run icons` and `npm run sw`.
